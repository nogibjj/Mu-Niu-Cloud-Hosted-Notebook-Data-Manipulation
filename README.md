## Cloud Hosted Notebook Data Manipulation Project


## Project Overview

This project is designed for data manipulation and analysis using Google Colab notebooks hosted in a cloud environment. The primary focus is to streamline data processing tasks and generate insights through visualizations and summary statistics, with a CI pipeline implemented using GitHub Actions for automated testing and code quality checks.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Processing**: Load data from CSV files and perform basic data cleaning and manipulation.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate visualizations using `matplotlib` to gain insights into data trends.
- **Summary Statistics**: Calculate and display summary statistics for data analysis.
- **CI**: GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing and linting to maintain code quality.
- **Requirements Management**: `requirements.txt` for managing dependencies.

## Requirements

Dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file for easy installation.
